## Overview 
Hello fellow developers! Iâ€™m pleased to present my solution for the Product Preview Card Component challenge from Front-end Mentor. In this project, I prioritized clean and well-organized code. I also had the chance to experiment with responsive images, which was quite exciting. Leveraging SASS(SCSS) and BEM methodology, I aimed for a more modular and maintainable codebase. For the cardâ€™s overall layout, I combined CSS Grid and Flexbox. ðŸš€ðŸ’»
